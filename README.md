# Work in Progress

This project is at it's early stages. Many changes will happen. Please do not make use of it as of yet. It's availible here in order to be able to discuss the project.

It is forked from the `TT::GUI` module from the TT_LibÂ² library.

It's goal is to provide wrapper classes to manipulate GUI control elements in SketchUp's `UI::WebDialog` API.

```ruby
w = SKUI::Window.new
b = SKUI::Button.new( 'Hello' ) { puts 'World! :)' }
b.position( 10, 5 )
w.add_control( b )
w.show
```
